## Next Steps

- [ ] Integrate Prisma Client into `todoService.ts` for database operations.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- [ ] How to best structure the memory bank for easy access and understanding.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- [ ] Follow the structure outlined in the project documentation.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- [ ] The memory bank is crucial for maintaining context across sessions.
- [ ] Models should be defined as interfaces unless complex logic or behavior is required.
- [ ] Created a `Todo` interface with `id`, `name`, `description`, and `status` fields. The `status` field is a `TodoStatus` enum with values `New`, `InProgress`, `Complete`, and `Abandoned`.
